## What is it?

It's a tool for packing applications along with all of its dependencies using the system package manager to obtain binaries and resolve dependencies. It creates a **self-sufficient** and **portable** bundle using the [AppImage](https://appimage.org) format.

Features:
- Real GNU/Linux packaging. (no more distro packaging)
- Simple recipes.
- Simple workflow.
- Backward and forward compatibility.
- One binary, many target systems.

## Developers

If you want to contribute, you can install this project from source like this:

(After cloning the repository)

### Requirements

This project requires python 3.8 to work!

### 1. Using pipenv

you can use [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/) (installed through pip) to simplify the process of setting up a virtual environment.

1. Create a virtual environment:

```shell
pipenv shell
```

if you do not have python 3.8 installed you can use another version like so:

```shell
pipenv shell --python path/to/python
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```shell
pipenv install
```

3. Add the current directory to the list of python modules:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH="`pwd`"
```

At this point you should be able to run appimage-builder by running `pipenv run appimagebuilder`!

### 2. Manual Installation

For those who don't want to use `pipenv` there's a `requirements.txt` file that contains all the dependencies.

Next you need to add the current directory to the list of python modules:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH="`pwd`"
```

Then you can run the project like so:

```shell
python appimagebuilder/__main__.py
```

### Notes

- This project uses the [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) code formatter.
